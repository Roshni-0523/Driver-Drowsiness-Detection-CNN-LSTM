# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection-CNN-LSTM
This project compares a classical computer-vision-based Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) method with a deep-learning-based CNN–LSTM hybrid model for real-time driver fatigue detection. The CNN–LSTM achieved 96.48% accuracy, outperforming traditional approaches and demonstrating robustness in low-light and occluded conditions.
